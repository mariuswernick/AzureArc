## What is Azure Arc?
Azure Arc is a set of technologies from Microsoft that extends Azure management and services to any infrastructure, including on-premises, multi-cloud, and edge environments. It enables you to:
- Manage servers, Kubernetes clusters, and applications outside Azure as if they were native Azure resources
- Apply Azure policies, security, and governance across your entire environment
- Use Azure services anywhere
